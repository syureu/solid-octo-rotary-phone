# Managing State

INTERMEDIATE

As your application grows,
it helps to be
more intentional about how your state is organized
and how the data flows between your components.
Redundant or duplicate state
is a common source of bugs.
In this chapter,
you’ll learn
how to structure your state well,
how to keep your state update logic maintainable,
and how to share state between distant components.

### In this chapter

- How to think about UI changes as state changes
- How to structure state well
- How to “lift state up” to share it between components
- How to control whether the state gets preserved or reset
- How to consolidate complex state logic in a function
- How to pass information without “prop drilling”
- How to scale state management as your app grows

## Reacting to input with state

With React,
you won’t modify the UI from code directly.
For example,
you won’t write commands
like “disable the button”, “enable the button”, “show the success message”, etc.
Instead,
you will describe the UI
you want to see
for the different visual states of your component
(“initial state”, “typing state”, “success state”),
and then trigger the state changes
in response to user input.
This is similar to
how designers think about UI.

Here is a quiz form built using React.
Note
how it uses the status state variable to determine
whether to enable or disable the submit button,
and whether to show the success message instead.

```jsx
// App.js
import { useState } from "react";

export default function Form() {
  const [answer, setAnswer] = useState("");
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);
  const [status, setStatus] = useState("typing");

  if (status === "success") {
    return <h1>That's right!</h1>;
  }

  async function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    setStatus("submitting");
    try {
      await submitForm(answer);
      setStatus("success");
    } catch (err) {
      setStatus("typing");
      setError(err);
    }
  }

  function handleTextareaChange(e) {
    setAnswer(e.target.value);
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h2>City quiz</h2>
      <p>
        In which city is there a billboard that turns air into drinkable water?
      </p>
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <textarea
          value={answer}
          onChange={handleTextareaChange}
          disabled={status === "submitting"}
        />
        <br />
        <button disabled={answer.length === 0 || status === "submitting"}>
          Submit
        </button>
        {error !== null && <p className="Error">{error.message}</p>}
      </form>
    </>
  );
}

function submitForm(answer) {
  // Pretend it's hitting the network.
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      let shouldError = answer.toLowerCase() !== "lima";
      if (shouldError) {
        reject(new Error("Good guess but a wrong answer. Try again!"));
      } else {
        resolve();
      }
    }, 1500);
  });
}
```
