# Managing State

INTERMEDIATE

As your application grows,
it helps to be
more intentional about how your state is organized
and how the data flows between your components.
Redundant or duplicate state
is a common source of bugs.
In this chapter,
you’ll learn
how to structure your state well,
how to keep your state update logic maintainable,
and how to share state between distant components.

### In this chapter

- How to think about UI changes as state changes
- How to structure state well
- How to “lift state up” to share it between components
- How to control whether the state gets preserved or reset
- How to consolidate complex state logic in a function
- How to pass information without “prop drilling”
- How to scale state management as your app grows

## Reacting to input with state

With React,
you won’t modify the UI from code directly.
For example,
you won’t write commands
like “disable the button”, “enable the button”, “show the success message”, etc.
Instead,
you will describe the UI
you want to see
for the different visual states of your component
(“initial state”, “typing state”, “success state”),
and then trigger the state changes
in response to user input.
This is similar to
how designers think about UI.

Here is a quiz form built using React.
Note
how it uses the status state variable to determine
whether to enable or disable the submit button,
and whether to show the success message instead.

```jsx
// App.js
import { useState } from "react";

export default function Form() {
  const [answer, setAnswer] = useState("");
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);
  const [status, setStatus] = useState("typing");

  if (status === "success") {
    return <h1>That's right!</h1>;
  }

  async function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    setStatus("submitting");
    try {
      await submitForm(answer);
      setStatus("success");
    } catch (err) {
      setStatus("typing");
      setError(err);
    }
  }

  function handleTextareaChange(e) {
    setAnswer(e.target.value);
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h2>City quiz</h2>
      <p>
        In which city is there a billboard that turns air into drinkable water?
      </p>
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <textarea
          value={answer}
          onChange={handleTextareaChange}
          disabled={status === "submitting"}
        />
        <br />
        <button disabled={answer.length === 0 || status === "submitting"}>
          Submit
        </button>
        {error !== null && <p className="Error">{error.message}</p>}
      </form>
    </>
  );
}

function submitForm(answer) {
  // Pretend it's hitting the network.
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      let shouldError = answer.toLowerCase() !== "lima";
      if (shouldError) {
        reject(new Error("Good guess but a wrong answer. Try again!"));
      } else {
        resolve();
      }
    }, 1500);
  });
}
```

## Choosing the state structure

Structuring state well
can make a difference between a component that
is pleasant to modify and debug,
and one that
is a constant source of bugs.
The most important principle is that
state shouldn’t contain
redundant or duplicated information.
If there’s unnecessary state,
it’s easy to forget to update it,
and introduce bugs!

For example,
this form has a redundant fullName state variable:

```jsx
// App.js
import { useState } from "react";

export default function Form() {
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState("");
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState("");
  const [fullName, setFullName] = useState("");

  function handleFirstNameChange(e) {
    setFirstName(e.target.value);
    setFullName(e.target.value + " " + lastName);
  }

  function handleLastNameChange(e) {
    setLastName(e.target.value);
    setFullName(firstName + " " + e.target.value);
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h2>Let’s check you in</h2>
      <label>
        First name: <input value={firstName} onChange={handleFirstNameChange} />
      </label>
      <label>
        Last name: <input value={lastName} onChange={handleLastNameChange} />
      </label>
      <p>
        Your ticket will be issued to: <b>{fullName}</b>
      </p>
    </>
  );
}
```

You can remove it
and simplify the code
by calculating fullName
while the component is rendering:

```jsx
// App.js
import { useState } from "react";

export default function Form() {
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState("");
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState("");

  const fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;

  function handleFirstNameChange(e) {
    setFirstName(e.target.value);
  }

  function handleLastNameChange(e) {
    setLastName(e.target.value);
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h2>Let’s check you in</h2>
      <label>
        First name: <input value={firstName} onChange={handleFirstNameChange} />
      </label>
      <label>
        Last name: <input value={lastName} onChange={handleLastNameChange} />
      </label>
      <p>
        Your ticket will be issued to: <b>{fullName}</b>
      </p>
    </>
  );
}
```

This might seem like a small change,
but many bugs in React apps are fixed this way.

## Sharing state between components

Sometimes,
you want the state of two components
to always change together.
To do it,
remove state from both of them,
move it to their closest common parent,
and then pass it down to them
via props.
This is known as
“lifting state up”,
and it’s one of the most common things
you will do writing React code.

In this example,
only one panel should be active at a time.
To achieve this,
instead of keeping the active state
inside each individual panel,
the parent component holds the state
and specifies the props for its children.

```jsx
// App.js
import { useState } from "react";

export default function Accordion() {
  const [activeIndex, setActiveIndex] = useState(0);
  return (
    <>
      <h2>Almaty, Kazakhstan</h2>
      <Panel
        title="About"
        isActive={activeIndex === 0}
        onShow={() => setActiveIndex(0)}
      >
        With a population of about 2 million, Almaty is Kazakhstan's largest
        city. From 1929 to 1997, it was its capital city.
      </Panel>
      <Panel
        title="Etymology"
        isActive={activeIndex === 1}
        onShow={() => setActiveIndex(1)}
      >
        The name comes from <span lang="kk-KZ">алма</span>, the Kazakh word for
        "apple" and is often translated as "full of apples". In fact, the region
        surrounding Almaty is thought to be the ancestral home of the apple, and
        the wild <i lang="la">Malus sieversii</i> is considered a likely
        candidate for the ancestor of the modern domestic apple.
      </Panel>
    </>
  );
}

function Panel({ title, children, isActive, onShow }) {
  return (
    <section className="panel">
      <h3>{title}</h3>
      {isActive ? <p>{children}</p> : <button onClick={onShow}>Show</button>}
    </section>
  );
}
```
