# Reacting to Input with State

React provides
a declarative way
to manipulate the UI.
Instead of manipulating individual pieces of the UI directly,
you describe the different states that
your component can be in,
and switch between them in response to the user input.
This is similar to
how designers think about the UI.

### You will learn

- How declarative UI programming differs from
  imperative UI programming
- How to
  enumerate the different visual states
  your component can be in
- How to
  trigger the changes
  between the different visual states from code

## How declarative UI compares to imperative

When you design UI interactions,
you probably think about
how the UI changes in response to user actions.
Consider a form that
lets the user submit an answer:

- When you type something into the form,
  the “Submit” button <b>becomes enabled.</b>
- When you press “Submit”,
  both the form and the button <b>become disabled,</b>
  and a spinner <b>appears.</b>
- If the network request succeeds,
  the form <b>gets hidden,</b>
  and the “Thank you” message <b>appears.</b>
- If the network request fails,
  an error message <b>appears,</b>
  and the form <b>becomes enabled</b> again.

In imperative programming,
the above corresponds directly to
how you implement interaction.
You have to write the exact instructions
to manipulate the UI depending on
what just happened.
Here’s another way to think about this:
imagine
riding next to someone in a car
and telling them turn by turn where to go.

They don’t know
where you want to go,
they just follow your commands.
(And if you get the directions wrong,
you end up in the wrong place!)
It’s called imperative
because you have to “command” each element,
from the spinner to the button,
telling the computer
how to update the UI.

In this example of imperative UI programming,
the form is built without React.
It only uses the browser DOM:

```jsx
// index.js
async function handleFormSubmit(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  disable(textarea);
  disable(button);
  show(loadingMessage);
  hide(errorMessage);
  try {
    await submitForm(textarea.value);
    show(successMessage);
    hide(form);
  } catch (err) {
    show(errorMessage);
    errorMessage.textContent = err.message;
  } finally {
    hide(loadingMessage);
    enable(textarea);
    enable(button);
  }
}

function handleTextareaChange() {
  if (textarea.value.length === 0) {
    disable(button);
  } else {
    enable(button);
  }
}

function hide(el) {
  el.style.display = "none";
}

function show(el) {
  el.style.display = "";
}

function enable(el) {
  el.disabled = false;
}

function disable(el) {
  el.disabled = true;
}

function submitForm(answer) {
  // Pretend it's hitting the network.
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      if (answer.toLowerCase() == "istanbul") {
        resolve();
      } else {
        reject(new Error("Good guess but a wrong answer. Try again!"));
      }
    }, 1500);
  });
}

let form = document.getElementById("form");
let textarea = document.getElementById("textarea");
let button = document.getElementById("button");
let loadingMessage = document.getElementById("loading");
let errorMessage = document.getElementById("error");
let successMessage = document.getElementById("success");
form.onsubmit = handleFormSubmit;
textarea.oninput = handleTextareaChange;

// index.html
<form id="form">
  <h2>City quiz</h2>
  <p>
    What city is located on two continents?
  </p>
  <textarea id="textarea"></textarea>
  <br />
  <button id="button" disabled>Submit</button>
  <p id="loading" style="display: none">Loading...</p>
  <p id="error" style="display: none; color: red;"></p>
</form>
<h1 id="success" style="display: none">That's right!</h1>

<style>
* { box-sizing: border-box; }
body { font-family: sans-serif; margin: 20px; padding: 0; }
</style>

```

Manipulating the UI imperatively
works well enough for isolated examples,
but it gets exponentially
more difficult to manage in
more complex systems.
Imagine
updating a page full of different forms
like this one.
Adding a new UI element
or a new interaction
would require carefully checking
all existing code
to make sure you haven’t introduced a bug
(for example,
forgetting to show or hide something).

React was built to solve this problem.

In React,
you don’t directly manipulate the UI
—meaning you don’t enable, disable, show, or hide components directly.
Instead,
you declare
what you want to show,
and React figures out
how to update the UI.
Think of getting into a taxi
and telling the driver
where you want to go
instead of telling them exactly where to turn.
It’s the driver’s job to get you there,
and they might even know some shortcuts you haven’t considered!

## Thinking about UI declaratively

You’ve seen
how to implement a form imperatively above.
To better understand
how to think in React,
you’ll walk through
reimplementing this
UI in React below:

1. <b>Identify</b> your component’s different visual states
2. <b>Determine</b> what triggers those state changes
3. <b>Represent</b> the state in memory using useState
4. <b>Remove</b> any non-essential state variables
5. <b>Connect</b> the event handlers to set the state

### Step 1: Identify your component’s different visual states

In computer science,
you may hear about a “state machine”
being in one of several “states”.
If you work with a designer,
you may have seen mockups for different “visual states”.
React stands at the intersection of design and computer science,
so both of these ideas are sources of inspiration.

First,
you need to visualize all the different “states” of the UI
the user might see:

- <b>Empty</b>: Form has a disabled “Submit” button.
- <b>Typing</b>: Form has an enabled “Submit” button.
- <b>Submitting</b>: Form is completely disabled. Spinner is shown.
- <b>Success</b>: “Thank you” message is shown instead of a form.
- <b>Error</b>: Same as Typing state, but with an extra error message.

Just like a designer,
you’ll want to “mock up”
or create “mocks” for the different states
before you add logic.
For example,
here is a mock for
just the visual part of the form.
This mock is controlled by a prop
called status with a default value of 'empty':

```jsx
// App.js
export default function Form({ status = "empty" }) {
  if (status === "success") {
    return <h1>That's right!</h1>;
  }
  return (
    <>
      <h2>City quiz</h2>
      <p>
        In which city is there a billboard that turns air into drinkable water?
      </p>
      <form>
        <textarea />
        <br />
        <button>Submit</button>
      </form>
    </>
  );
}
```

You could call that prop anything you like,
the naming is not important.
Try editing status = 'empty' to status = 'success'
to see the success message appear.
Mocking lets you quickly iterate on the UI
before you wire up any logic.
Here is a more fleshed out
prototype of the same component,
still “controlled” by the status prop:

```jsx
// App.js
export default function Form({
  // Try 'submitting', 'error', 'success':
  status = "empty",
}) {
  if (status === "success") {
    return <h1>That's right!</h1>;
  }
  return (
    <>
      <h2>City quiz</h2>
      <p>
        In which city is there a billboard that turns air into drinkable water?
      </p>
      <form>
        <textarea disabled={status === "submitting"} />
        <br />
        <button disabled={status === "empty" || status === "submitting"}>
          Submit
        </button>
        {status === "error" && (
          <p className="Error">Good guess but a wrong answer. Try again!</p>
        )}
      </form>
    </>
  );
}
```

### DEEP DIVE

Displaying many visual states at once

If a component has a lot of visual states,
it can be convenient to show them all on one page:

```jsx
// App.js
import Form from './Form.js';

let statuses = [
  'empty',
  'typing',
  'submitting',
  'success',
  'error',
];

export default function App() {
  return (
    <>
      {statuses.map(status => (
        <section key={status}>
          <h4>Form ({status}):</h4>
          <Form status={status} />
        </section>
      ))}
    </>
  );
}

// Form.js
export default function Form({ status }) {
  if (status === 'success') {
    return <h1>That's right!</h1>
  }
  return (
    <form>
      <textarea disabled={
        status === 'submitting'
      } />
      <br />
      <button disabled={
        status === 'empty' ||
        status === 'submitting'
      }>
        Submit
      </button>
      {status === 'error' &&
        <p className="Error">
          Good guess but a wrong answer. Try again!
        </p>
      }
    </form>
  );
}
```

Pages like this
are often called
“living styleguides” or “storybooks”.
