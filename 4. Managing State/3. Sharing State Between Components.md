# Sharing State Between Components

Sometimes,
you want the state of two components
to always change together.
To do it,
remove state from both of them,
move it to their closest common parent,
and then pass it down to them via props.
This is known as lifting state up,
and it’s one of the most common things
you will do writing React code.

### You will learn

- How to share state
  between components by lifting it up
- What are controlled
  and uncontrolled components

## Lifting state up by example

In this example,
a parent Accordion component
renders two separate Panels:

<ul>
    <li>Accordion</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Panel</li>
        <li>Panel</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

Each Panel component
has a boolean isActive state that
determines whether its content is visible.

Press the Show button for both panels:

```jsx
// App.js
import { useState } from "react";

function Panel({ title, children }) {
  const [isActive, setIsActive] = useState(false);
  return (
    <section className="panel">
      <h3>{title}</h3>
      {isActive ? (
        <p>{children}</p>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={() => setIsActive(true)}>Show</button>
      )}
    </section>
  );
}

export default function Accordion() {
  return (
    <>
      <h2>Almaty, Kazakhstan</h2>
      <Panel title="About">
        With a population of about 2 million, Almaty is Kazakhstan's largest
        city. From 1929 to 1997, it was its capital city.
      </Panel>
      <Panel title="Etymology">
        The name comes from <span lang="kk-KZ">алма</span>, the Kazakh word for
        "apple" and is often translated as "full of apples". In fact, the region
        surrounding Almaty is thought to be the ancestral home of the apple, and
        the wild <i lang="la">Malus sieversii</i> is considered a likely
        candidate for the ancestor of the modern domestic apple.
      </Panel>
    </>
  );
}
```
