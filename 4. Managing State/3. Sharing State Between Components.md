# Sharing State Between Components

Sometimes,
you want the state of two components
to always change together.
To do it,
remove state from both of them,
move it to their closest common parent,
and then pass it down to them via props.
This is known as lifting state up,
and it’s one of the most common things
you will do writing React code.

### You will learn

- How to share state
  between components by lifting it up
- What are controlled
  and uncontrolled components

## Lifting state up by example

In this example,
a parent Accordion component
renders two separate Panels:

<ul>
    <li>Accordion</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Panel</li>
        <li>Panel</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

Each Panel component
has a boolean isActive state that
determines whether its content is visible.

Press the Show button for both panels:

```jsx
// App.js
import { useState } from "react";

function Panel({ title, children }) {
  const [isActive, setIsActive] = useState(false);
  return (
    <section className="panel">
      <h3>{title}</h3>
      {isActive ? (
        <p>{children}</p>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={() => setIsActive(true)}>Show</button>
      )}
    </section>
  );
}

export default function Accordion() {
  return (
    <>
      <h2>Almaty, Kazakhstan</h2>
      <Panel title="About">
        With a population of about 2 million, Almaty is Kazakhstan's largest
        city. From 1929 to 1997, it was its capital city.
      </Panel>
      <Panel title="Etymology">
        The name comes from <span lang="kk-KZ">алма</span>, the Kazakh word for
        "apple" and is often translated as "full of apples". In fact, the region
        surrounding Almaty is thought to be the ancestral home of the apple, and
        the wild <i lang="la">Malus sieversii</i> is considered a likely
        candidate for the ancestor of the modern domestic apple.
      </Panel>
    </>
  );
}
```

Notice how pressing one panel’s button
does not affect the other panel—they are independent.

![](https://react.dev/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdocs%2Fdiagrams%2Fsharing_state_child.dark.png&w=1080&q=75)

Initially,
each Panel’s isActive state is false,
so they both appear collapsed

![](https://react.dev/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdocs%2Fdiagrams%2Fsharing_state_child_clicked.dark.png&w=1080&q=75)

Clicking either Panel’s button
will only update that Panel’s isActive state alone

<b>But now let’s say you want to change it
so that only one panel is expanded at any given time.</b>
With that design,
expanding the second panel
should collapse the first one.
How would you do that?

To coordinate these two panels,
you need to “lift their state up” to a parent component  
in three steps:

1. <b>Remove</b> state from the child components.
2. <b>Pass</b> hardcoded data from the common parent.
3. <b>Add</b> state to the common parent
   and pass it down together with the event handlers.

This will allow the Accordion component
to coordinate both Panels
and only expand one at a time.

### Step 1: Remove state from the child components

You will give control of the Panel’s isActive
to its parent component.
This means that
the parent component
will pass isActive to Panel
as a prop instead.
Start by removing this line
from the Panel component:

```jsx
const [isActive, setIsActive] = useState(false);
```

And instead,
add isActive to the Panel’s list of props:

```jsx
function Panel({ title, children, isActive }) {
```

Now the Panel’s parent component
can control isActive
by passing it down as a prop.
Conversely,
the Panel component
now has no control over the value of isActive
—it’s now up to the parent component!

### Step 2: Pass hardcoded data from the common parent

To lift state up,
you must locate the closest common parent component of both of the child components
that you want to coordinate:

<ul>
  <li>Accordion (closest common parent)</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Panel</li>
    <li>Panel</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

In this example,
it’s the Accordion component.
Since it’s above both panels
and can control their props,
it will become the “source of truth” for
which panel is currently active.
Make the Accordion component
pass a hardcoded value of isActive
(for example, true) to both panels:

```jsx
// App.js
import { useState } from "react";

export default function Accordion() {
  return (
    <>
      <h2>Almaty, Kazakhstan</h2>
      <Panel title="About" isActive={true}>
        With a population of about 2 million, Almaty is Kazakhstan's largest
        city. From 1929 to 1997, it was its capital city.
      </Panel>
      <Panel title="Etymology" isActive={true}>
        The name comes from <span lang="kk-KZ">алма</span>, the Kazakh word for
        "apple" and is often translated as "full of apples". In fact, the region
        surrounding Almaty is thought to be the ancestral home of the apple, and
        the wild <i lang="la">Malus sieversii</i> is considered a likely
        candidate for the ancestor of the modern domestic apple.
      </Panel>
    </>
  );
}

function Panel({ title, children, isActive }) {
  return (
    <section className="panel">
      <h3>{title}</h3>
      {isActive ? (
        <p>{children}</p>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={() => setIsActive(true)}>Show</button>
      )}
    </section>
  );
}
```

Try editing the hardcoded isActive values in the Accordion component
and see the result on the screen.

### Step 3: Add state to the common parent

Lifting state up
often changes the nature of
what you’re storing as state.

In this case,
only one panel
should be active at a time.
This means that
the Accordion common parent component
needs to keep track of
which panel is the active one.
Instead of a boolean value,
it could use
a number as the index of the active Panel for the state variable:

```jsx
const [activeIndex, setActiveIndex] = useState(0);
```

When the activeIndex is 0,
the first panel is active,
and when it’s 1,
it’s the second one.

Clicking the “Show” button in either Panel
needs to change the active index in Accordion.
A Panel can’t set the activeIndex state directly
because it’s defined inside the Accordion.
The Accordion component
needs to explicitly allow
the Panel component to change its state
by passing an event handler down
as a prop:

```jsx
<>
  <Panel isActive={activeIndex === 0} onShow={() => setActiveIndex(0)}>
    ...
  </Panel>
  <Panel isActive={activeIndex === 1} onShow={() => setActiveIndex(1)}>
    ...
  </Panel>
</>
```

The \<button> inside the Panel
will now use the onShow prop as its click event handler:

```jsx
// App.js
import { useState } from "react";

export default function Accordion() {
  const [activeIndex, setActiveIndex] = useState(0);
  return (
    <>
      <h2>Almaty, Kazakhstan</h2>
      <Panel
        title="About"
        isActive={activeIndex === 0}
        onShow={() => setActiveIndex(0)}
      >
        With a population of about 2 million, Almaty is Kazakhstan's largest
        city. From 1929 to 1997, it was its capital city.
      </Panel>
      <Panel
        title="Etymology"
        isActive={activeIndex === 1}
        onShow={() => setActiveIndex(1)}
      >
        The name comes from <span lang="kk-KZ">алма</span>, the Kazakh word for
        "apple" and is often translated as "full of apples". In fact, the region
        surrounding Almaty is thought to be the ancestral home of the apple, and
        the wild <i lang="la">Malus sieversii</i> is considered a likely
        candidate for the ancestor of the modern domestic apple.
      </Panel>
    </>
  );
}

function Panel({ title, children, isActive, onShow }) {
  return (
    <section className="panel">
      <h3>{title}</h3>
      {isActive ? <p>{children}</p> : <button onClick={onShow}>Show</button>}
    </section>
  );
}
```

This completes lifting state up!
Moving state into the common parent component
allowed you to coordinate the two panels.
Using the active index
instead of two “is shown” flags
ensured that
only one panel is active at a given time.
And passing down the event handler to the child
allowed the child to change the parent’s state.

Initially,
Accordion’s activeIndex is 0,
so the first Panel receives isActive = true

![](https://react.dev/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdocs%2Fdiagrams%2Fsharing_state_parent_clicked.dark.png&w=1080&q=75)

When Accordion’s activeIndex state changes to 1,
the second Panel receives isActive = true instead
