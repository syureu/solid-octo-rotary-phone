# JavaScript in JSX with Curly Braces

JSX lets you write HTML-like markup inside a JavaScript file,
keeping rendering logic and content in the same place.
Sometimes you will want to add a little JavaScript logic
or reference a dynamic property inside that markup.
In this situation,
you can use curly braces in your JSX to open a window to JavaScript.

## Passing strings with quotes

When you want to pass a string attribute to JSX,
you put it in single or double quotes:

```jsx
// App.js
export default function Avatar() {
  return (
    <img
      className="avatar"
      src="https://i.imgur.com/7vQD0fPs.jpg"
      alt="Gregorio Y. Zara"
    />
  );
}
```
