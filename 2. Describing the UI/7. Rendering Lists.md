# Rendering Lists

You will often want to display multiple similar components from a collection of data.
You can use the JavaScript array methods to manipulate an array of data.
On this page, you’ll use filter() and map() with React to filter and transform your array of data into an array of components.

## Rendering data from arrays

Say that you have a list of content.

```jsx
<ul>
  <li>Creola Katherine Johnson: mathematician</li>
  <li>Mario José Molina-Pasquel Henríquez: chemist</li>
  <li>Mohammad Abdus Salam: physicist</li>
  <li>Percy Lavon Julian: chemist</li>
  <li>Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar: astrophysicist</li>
</ul>
```

The only difference among those list items is their contents, their data.
You will often need to show several instances of the same component
using different data when building interfaces:
from lists of comments to galleries of profile images.
In these situations, you can store that data in JavaScript objects and arrays and use methods like map() and filter() to render lists of components from them.

Here’s a short example of how to generate a list of items from an array:

1. <b>Move</b> the data into an array:

```jsx
const people = [
  "Creola Katherine Johnson: mathematician",
  "Mario José Molina-Pasquel Henríquez: chemist",
  "Mohammad Abdus Salam: physicist",
  "Percy Lavon Julian: chemist",
  "Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar: astrophysicist",
];
```

2. <b>Map</b> the people members into a new array of JSX nodes, listItems:

```jsx
const listItems = people.map((person) => <li>{person}</li>);
```

3. <b>Return</b> listItems from your component wrapped in a <ul>:

```jsx
return <ul>{listItems}</ul>;
```

Here is the result:

```jsx
// App.js
const people = [
  "Creola Katherine Johnson: mathematician",
  "Mario José Molina-Pasquel Henríquez: chemist",
  "Mohammad Abdus Salam: physicist",
  "Percy Lavon Julian: chemist",
  "Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar: astrophysicist",
];

export default function List() {
  const listItems = people.map((person) => <li>{person}</li>);
  return <ul>{listItems}</ul>;
}
```

```
Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.

Check the render method of `List`. See https://reactjs.org/link/warning-keys for more information.
    at li
    at List
```

Notice the sandbox above displays a console error:

```
Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique “key” prop.
```

You’ll learn how to fix this error later on this page.
Before we get to that, let’s add some structure to your data.

## Filtering arrays of items

This data can be structured even more.

```jsx
const people = [
  {
    id: 0,
    name: "Creola Katherine Johnson",
    profession: "mathematician",
  },
  {
    id: 1,
    name: "Mario José Molina-Pasquel Henríquez",
    profession: "chemist",
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    name: "Mohammad Abdus Salam",
    profession: "physicist",
  },
  {
    name: "Percy Lavon Julian",
    profession: "chemist",
  },
  {
    name: "Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar",
    profession: "astrophysicist",
  },
];
```

Let’s say you want a way to only show people whose profession is 'chemist'.
You can use JavaScript’s filter() method to return just those people.
This method takes an array of items,
passes them through a “test”
(a function that returns true or false),
nd returns a new array of only those items
that passed the test (returned true).

You only want the items where profession is 'chemist'.
The “test” function for this looks like (person) => person.profession === 'chemist'.
Here’s how to put it together:

1. <b>Create</b> a new array of just “chemist” people, chemists,
   by calling filter() on the people filtering by person.profession === 'chemist':

```jsx
const chemists = people.filter((person) => person.profession === "chemist");
```

2. Now <b>map</b> over chemists:

```jsx
const listItems = chemists.map((person) => (
  <li>
    <img src={getImageUrl(person)} alt={person.name} />
    <p>
      <b>{person.name}:</b>
      {" " + person.profession + " "}
      known for {person.accomplishment}
    </p>
  </li>
));
```

3. Lastly, <b>return</b> the listItems from your component:

```jsx
return <ul>{listItems}</ul>;
```

```jsx
// App.js
import { people } from "./data.js";
import { getImageUrl } from "./utils.js";

export default function List() {
  const chemists = people.filter((person) => person.profession === "chemist");
  const listItems = chemists.map((person) => (
    <li>
      <img src={getImageUrl(person)} alt={person.name} />
      <p>
        <b>{person.name}:</b>
        {" " + person.profession + " "}
        known for {person.accomplishment}
      </p>
    </li>
  ));
  return <ul>{listItems}</ul>;
}

// data.js
export const people = [
  {
    id: 0,
    name: "Creola Katherine Johnson",
    profession: "mathematician",
    accomplishment: "spaceflight calculations",
    imageId: "MK3eW3A",
  },
  {
    id: 1,
    name: "Mario José Molina-Pasquel Henríquez",
    profession: "chemist",
    accomplishment: "discovery of Arctic ozone hole",
    imageId: "mynHUSa",
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    name: "Mohammad Abdus Salam",
    profession: "physicist",
    accomplishment: "electromagnetism theory",
    imageId: "bE7W1ji",
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    name: "Percy Lavon Julian",
    profession: "chemist",
    accomplishment:
      "pioneering cortisone drugs, steroids and birth control pills",
    imageId: "IOjWm71",
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    name: "Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar",
    profession: "astrophysicist",
    accomplishment: "white dwarf star mass calculations",
    imageId: "lrWQx8l",
  },
];

// utils.js
export function getImageUrl(person) {
  return "https://i.imgur.com/" + person.imageId + "s.jpg";
}
```

```

    at li
    at List
```

### Pitfall

Arrow functions implicitly return the expression right after =>,
so you didn’t need a return statement:

```jsx
const listItems = chemists.map(
  (person) => <li>...</li> // Implicit return!
);
```

However, you must write return explicitly
if your => is followed by a { curly brace!

```jsx
const listItems = chemists.map((person) => {
  // Curly brace
  return <li>...</li>;
});
```

Arrow functions containing => { are said to have a “block body”.
They let you write more than a single line of code,
but you have to write a return statement yourself.
If you forget it, nothing gets returned!

## Keeping list items in order with key

Notice that all the sandboxes above show an error in the console:

```
Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique “key” prop.
```

You need to give each array item a key
— a string or a number
that uniquely identifies it among other items in that array:

```jsx
<li key={person.id}>...</li>
```

### Note

JSX elements directly inside a map() call always need keys!
Keys tell React
which array item each component corresponds to,
so that it can match them up later.
This becomes important
if your array items can move
(e.g. due to sorting),
get inserted,
or get deleted.
A well-chosen key helps React infer what exactly has happened,
and make the correct updates to the DOM tree.

Rather than generating keys on the fly,
you should include them in your data:

```jsx
// App.js
import { people } from "./data.js";
import { getImageUrl } from "./utils.js";

export default function List() {
  const listItems = people.map((person) => (
    <li key={person.id}>
      <img src={getImageUrl(person)} alt={person.name} />
      <p>
        <b>{person.name}</b>
        {" " + person.profession + " "}
        known for {person.accomplishment}
      </p>
    </li>
  ));
  return <ul>{listItems}</ul>;
}

// data.js
export const people = [
  {
    id: 0, // Used in JSX as a key
    name: "Creola Katherine Johnson",
    profession: "mathematician",
    accomplishment: "spaceflight calculations",
    imageId: "MK3eW3A",
  },
  {
    id: 1, // Used in JSX as a key
    name: "Mario José Molina-Pasquel Henríquez",
    profession: "chemist",
    accomplishment: "discovery of Arctic ozone hole",
    imageId: "mynHUSa",
  },
  {
    id: 2, // Used in JSX as a key
    name: "Mohammad Abdus Salam",
    profession: "physicist",
    accomplishment: "electromagnetism theory",
    imageId: "bE7W1ji",
  },
  {
    id: 3, // Used in JSX as a key
    name: "Percy Lavon Julian",
    profession: "chemist",
    accomplishment:
      "pioneering cortisone drugs, steroids and birth control pills",
    imageId: "IOjWm71",
  },
  {
    id: 4, // Used in JSX as a key
    name: "Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar",
    profession: "astrophysicist",
    accomplishment: "white dwarf star mass calculations",
    imageId: "lrWQx8l",
  },
];

// utils.js
export function getImageUrl(person) {
  return "https://i.imgur.com/" + person.imageId + "s.jpg";
}
```

### DEEP DIVE

Displaying several DOM nodes for each list item
What do you do
when each item needs to render not one,
but several DOM nodes?

The short \<>...\</> Fragment syntax
won’t let you pass a key,
so you need to either group them into a single \<div>,
or use the slightly longer and more explicit \<Fragment> syntax:

```jsx
import { Fragment } from "react";

// ...

const listItems = people.map((person) => (
  <Fragment key={person.id}>
    <h1>{person.name}</h1>
    <p>{person.bio}</p>
  </Fragment>
));
```

Fragments disappear from the DOM,
so this will produce a flat list of \<h1>, \<p>, \<h1>, \<p>, and so on.
