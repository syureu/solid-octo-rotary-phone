# Rendering Lists

You will often want to display multiple similar components from a collection of data.
You can use the JavaScript array methods to manipulate an array of data.
On this page, you’ll use filter() and map() with React to filter and transform your array of data into an array of components.

## Rendering data from arrays

Say that you have a list of content.

```jsx
<ul>
  <li>Creola Katherine Johnson: mathematician</li>
  <li>Mario José Molina-Pasquel Henríquez: chemist</li>
  <li>Mohammad Abdus Salam: physicist</li>
  <li>Percy Lavon Julian: chemist</li>
  <li>Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar: astrophysicist</li>
</ul>
```

The only difference among those list items is their contents, their data.
You will often need to show several instances of the same component
using different data when building interfaces:
from lists of comments to galleries of profile images.
In these situations, you can store that data in JavaScript objects and arrays and use methods like map() and filter() to render lists of components from them.

Here’s a short example of how to generate a list of items from an array:

1. <b>Move</b> the data into an array:

```jsx
const people = [
  "Creola Katherine Johnson: mathematician",
  "Mario José Molina-Pasquel Henríquez: chemist",
  "Mohammad Abdus Salam: physicist",
  "Percy Lavon Julian: chemist",
  "Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar: astrophysicist",
];
```

2. <b>Map</b> the people members into a new array of JSX nodes, listItems:

```jsx
const listItems = people.map((person) => <li>{person}</li>);
```

3. <b>Return</b> listItems from your component wrapped in a <ul>:

```jsx
return <ul>{listItems}</ul>;
```

Here is the result:

```jsx
// App.js
const people = [
  "Creola Katherine Johnson: mathematician",
  "Mario José Molina-Pasquel Henríquez: chemist",
  "Mohammad Abdus Salam: physicist",
  "Percy Lavon Julian: chemist",
  "Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar: astrophysicist",
];

export default function List() {
  const listItems = people.map((person) => <li>{person}</li>);
  return <ul>{listItems}</ul>;
}
```

```
Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.

Check the render method of `List`. See https://reactjs.org/link/warning-keys for more information.
    at li
    at List
```

Notice the sandbox above displays a console error:

```
Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique “key” prop.
```

You’ll learn how to fix this error later on this page.
Before we get to that, let’s add some structure to your data.
