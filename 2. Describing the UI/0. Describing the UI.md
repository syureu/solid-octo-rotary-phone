# Describing the UI

React is a JavaScript library
for rendering user interfaces (UI).
UI is built from small units
like buttons, text, and images.
React lets you combine them into reusable, nestable components.
From web sites to phone apps,
everything on the screen can be broken down into components.
In this chapter,
you’ll learn to create, customize, and conditionally display React components.

- How to write your first React component
- When and how to create multi-component files
- How to add markup to JavaScript with JSX
- How to use curly braces with JSX
  to access JavaScript functionality from your components
- How to configure components with props
- How to conditionally render components
- How to render multiple components at a time
- How to avoid confusing bugs
  by keeping components pure

## Your first component

React applications are built from isolated pieces of UI called components.
A React component is a JavaScript function
that you can sprinkle with markup.
Components can be as small as a button,
or as large as an entire page.
Here is a Gallery component rendering three Profile components:

```jsx
// App.js
function Profile() {
  return <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg" alt="Katherine Johnson" />;
}

export default function Gallery() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Amazing scientists</h1>
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
    </section>
  );
}
```

## Importing and exporting components

You can declare many components in one file,
but large files can get difficult to navigate.
To solve this, you can export a component into its own file,
and then import that component from another file:

```jsx
// Gallery.js
import Profile from './Profile.js';

export default function Gallery() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Amazing scientists</h1>
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
    </section>
  );
}

// Profile.js
export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <img
      src="https://i.imgur.com/QIrZWGIs.jpg"
      alt="Alan L. Hart"
    />
  );
}
```

### Writing markup with JSX

Each React component is a JavaScript function
that may contain some markup that React renders into the browser.
React components use a syntax extension called JSX
to represent that markup.
JSX looks a lot like HTML,
but it is a bit stricter
and can display dynamic information.

If we paste existing HTML markup into a React component,
it won’t always work:

```jsx
// App.js
export default function TodoList() {
  return (
    // This doesn't quite work!
    <h1>Hedy Lamarr's Todos</h1>
    <img
      src="https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg"
      alt="Hedy Lamarr"
      class="photo"
    >
    <ul>
      <li>Invent new traffic lights
      <li>Rehearse a movie scene
      <li>Improve spectrum technology
    </ul>
  );
}
```

```
Error
/App.js: Adjacent JSX elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag. Did you want a JSX fragment <>...</>? (5:4)

  3 |     // This doesn't quite work!
  4 |     <h1>Hedy Lamarr's Todos</h1>
> 5 |     <img
    |     ^
  6 |       src="https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg"
  7 |       alt="Hedy Lamarr"
  8 |       class="photo"
```

If you have existing HTML like this,
you can fix it using a converter:

```jsx
// App.js
export default function TodoList() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Hedy Lamarr's Todos</h1>
      <img
        src="https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg"
        alt="Hedy Lamarr"
        className="photo"
      />
      <ul>
        <li>Invent new traffic lights</li>
        <li>Rehearse a movie scene</li>
        <li>Improve spectrum technology</li>
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}
```

## JavaScript in JSX with curly braces

JSX lets you write HTML-like markup inside a JavaScript file,
keeping rendering logic and content in the same place.
Sometimes you will want to add a little JavaScript logic
or reference a dynamic property inside that markup.
In this situation, you can use curly braces in your JSX
to “open a window” to JavaScript:

```jsx
// App.js
const person = {
  name: "Gregorio Y. Zara",
  theme: {
    backgroundColor: "black",
    color: "pink",
  },
};

export default function TodoList() {
  return (
    <div style={person.theme}>
      <h1>{person.name}'s Todos</h1>
      <img
        className="avatar"
        src="https://i.imgur.com/7vQD0fPs.jpg"
        alt="Gregorio Y. Zara"
      />
      <ul>
        <li>Improve the videophone</li>
        <li>Prepare aeronautics lectures</li>
        <li>Work on the alcohol-fuelled engine</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```
