# Describing the UI

React is a JavaScript library
for rendering user interfaces (UI).
UI is built from small units
like buttons, text, and images.
React lets you combine them into reusable, nestable components.
From web sites to phone apps,
everything on the screen can be broken down into components.
In this chapter,
youâ€™ll learn to create, customize, and conditionally display React components.

- When and how to create multi-component files
- How to add markup to JavaScript with JSX
- How to use curly braces with JSX
  to access JavaScript functionality from your components
- How to configure components with props
- How to conditionally render components
- How to render multiple components at a time
- How to avoid confusing bugs
  by keeping components pure

## Your first component

React applications are built from isolated pieces of UI called components.
A React component is a JavaScript function
that you can sprinkle with markup.
Components can be as small as a button,
or as large as an entire page.
Here is a Gallery component rendering three Profile components:

```jsx
// App.js
function Profile() {
  return <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg" alt="Katherine Johnson" />;
}

export default function Gallery() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Amazing scientists</h1>
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
    </section>
  );
}
```

## Importing and exporting components

You can declare many components in one file,
but large files can get difficult to navigate.
To solve this, you can export a component into its own file,
and then import that component from another file:

```jsx
// Gallery.js
import Profile from './Profile.js';

export default function Gallery() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Amazing scientists</h1>
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
    </section>
  );
}

// Profile.js
export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <img
      src="https://i.imgur.com/QIrZWGIs.jpg"
      alt="Alan L. Hart"
    />
  );
}
```
