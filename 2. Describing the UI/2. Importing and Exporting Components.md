# Importing and Exporting Components

The magic of components lies in their reusability:
you can create components that are composed of other components.
But as you nest more and more components,
it often makes sense to start splitting them into different files.
This lets you keep your files easy to scan and reuse components in more places.

### You will learn

- What a root component file is
- How to import and export a component
- When to use default and named imports and exports
- How to import and export multiple components from one file
- How to split components into multiple files

## The root component file

In Your First Component,
you made a Profile component
and a Gallery component that renders it:

```jsx
// App.js
function Profile() {
  return <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg" alt="Katherine Johnson" />;
}

export default function Gallery() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Amazing scientists</h1>
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
    </section>
  );
}
```

These currently live in a root component file,
named App.js in this example.
In Create React App, your app lives in src/App.js.
Depending on your setup, your root component could be in another file, though.If you use a framework with file-based routing, such as Next.js,
your root component will be different for every page.

## Exporting and importing a component

What if you want to change the landing screen in the future
and put a list of science books there?
Or place all the profiles somewhere else?
It makes sense to move Gallery and Profile out of the root component file.
This will make them more modular and reusable in other files.
You can move a component in three steps:

1. Make a new JS file to put the components in.
2. Export your function component from that file
   (using either default or named exports).
3. Import it in the file where you’ll use the component
   (using the corresponding technique for importing default or named exports).

Here both Profile and Gallery have been moved out of App.js into a new file called Gallery.js.
Now you can change App.js to import Gallery from Gallery.js

```jsx
// App.js
import Gallery from "./Gallery.js";

export default function App() {
  return <Gallery />;
}

// Gallery.js
function Profile() {
  return (
    <img
      src="https://i.imgur.com/QIrZWGIs.jpg"
      alt="Alan L. Hart"
    />
  );
}

export default function Gallery() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Amazing scientists</h1>
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
    </section>
  );
}

```

Notice how this example is broken down into two component files now:

<ol>
    <li>Gallery.js:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Defines the Profile component which is only used within the same file and is not exported.</li>
        <li>Exports the Gallery component as a default export.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>App.js:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Imports Gallery as a default import from Gallery.js.</li>
        <li>Exports the root App component as a default export.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

### Note

You may encounter files that leave off the .js file extension like so:

```jsx
import Gallery from "./Gallery";
```

Either './Gallery.js' or './Gallery' will work with React,
though the former is closer to how native ES Modules work.

### DEEP DIVE

#### Default vs named exports

There are two primary ways to export values with JavaScript:
default exports and named exports.
So far, our examples have only used default exports.
But you can use one or both of them in the same file.
A file can have no more than one default export,
but it can have as many named exports as you like.

![](https://react.dev/images/docs/illustrations/i_import-export.svg)

How you export your component
dictates how you must import it.
You will get an error
if you try to import a default export
the same way you would a named export!
This chart can help you keep track:

| Syntax  | Export statement                    | Import statement                      |
| ------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Default | export default function Button() {} | import Button from './Button.js';     |
| Named   | export function Button() {}         | import { Button } from './Button.js'; |

When you write a default import,
you can put any name you want after import.
For example, you could write
import Banana from './Button.js'
instead
and it would still provide you with the same default export.
In contrast, with named imports,
the name has to match on both sides.
That’s why they are called named imports!

<b>People often use default exports
if the file exports only one component,
and use named exports
if it exports multiple components and values.</b>
Regardless of which coding style you prefer,
always give meaningful names to your component functions
and the files that contain them.
Components without names,
like export default () => {}, are discouraged
because they make debugging harder.
