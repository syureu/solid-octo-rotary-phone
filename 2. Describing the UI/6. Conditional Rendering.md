# Conditional Rendering

Your components will often need to display different things
depending on different conditions.
In React, you can conditionally render JSX
using JavaScript syntax like if statements, &&, and ? : operators.

## Conditionally returning JSX

Let’s say you have a PackingList component rendering several Items,
which can be marked as packed or not:

```jsx
// App.js
function Item({ name, isPacked }) {
  return <li className="item">{name}</li>;
}

export default function PackingList() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Sally Ride's Packing List</h1>
      <ul>
        <Item isPacked={true} name="Space suit" />
        <Item isPacked={true} name="Helmet with a golden leaf" />
        <Item isPacked={false} name="Photo of Tam" />
      </ul>
    </section>
  );
}
```
