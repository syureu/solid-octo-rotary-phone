# Keeping Components Pure

Some JavaScript functions are pure.
Pure functions only perform a calculation and nothing more.
By strictly only writing your components as pure functions,
you can avoid
an entire class of baffling bugs
and unpredictable behavior as your codebase grows.
To get these benefits,
though,
there are a few rules you must follow.

### You will learn

- What purity is
  and how it helps you avoid bugs
- How to keep components pure
  by keeping changes out of the render phase
- How to use Strict Mode
  to find mistakes in your components

## Purity: Components as formulas

In computer science
(and especially the world of functional programming),
a pure function
is a function
with the following characteristics:

- <b>It minds its own business.</b>
  It does not change any objects or variables
  that existed before it was called.
- <b>Same inputs, same output.</b>
  Given the same inputs,
  a pure function should always return the same result.

You might already be familiar with one example of pure functions:
formulas in math.

Consider this math formula: y = 2x.

If x = 2 then y = 4. Always.

If x = 3 then y = 6. Always.

If x = 3, y won’t sometimes be 9 or –1 or 2.5
depending on the time of day or the state of the stock market.

If y = 2x and x = 3, y will always be 6.

If we made this into a JavaScript function,
it would look like this:

```jsx
function double(number) {
  return 2 * number;
}
```

In the above example,
double is a pure function.
If you pass it 3,
it will return 6. Always.

React is designed around this concept.
<b>React assumes that every component you write is a pure function.</b>
This means that React components you write
must always return the same JSX
given the same inputs:

```jsx
// App.js
function Recipe({ drinkers }) {
  return (
    <ol>
      <li>Boil {drinkers} cups of water.</li>
      <li>
        Add {drinkers} spoons of tea and {0.5 * drinkers} spoons of spice.
      </li>
      <li>Add {0.5 * drinkers} cups of milk to boil and sugar to taste.</li>
    </ol>
  );
}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Spiced Chai Recipe</h1>
      <h2>For two</h2>
      <Recipe drinkers={2} />
      <h2>For a gathering</h2>
      <Recipe drinkers={4} />
    </section>
  );
}
```

When you pass drinkers={2} to Recipe,
it will return JSX containing 2 cups of water.
Always.

If you pass drinkers={4},
it will return JSX containing 4 cups of water.
Always.

Just like a math formula.

You could think of your components as recipes:
if you follow them
and don’t introduce new ingredients
during the cooking process,
you will get the same dish every time.
That “dish” is the JSX
that the component serves to React to render.
