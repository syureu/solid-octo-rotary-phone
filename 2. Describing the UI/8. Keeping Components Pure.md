# Keeping Components Pure

Some JavaScript functions are pure.
Pure functions only perform a calculation and nothing more.
By strictly only writing your components as pure functions,
you can avoid
an entire class of baffling bugs
and unpredictable behavior as your codebase grows.
To get these benefits,
though,
there are a few rules you must follow.

### You will learn

- What purity is
  and how it helps you avoid bugs
- How to keep components pure
  by keeping changes out of the render phase
- How to use Strict Mode
  to find mistakes in your components

## Purity: Components as formulas

In computer science
(and especially the world of functional programming),
a pure function
is a function
with the following characteristics:

- <b>It minds its own business.</b>
  It does not change any objects or variables
  that existed before it was called.
- <b>Same inputs, same output.</b>
  Given the same inputs,
  a pure function should always return the same result.

You might already be familiar with one example of pure functions:
formulas in math.

Consider this math formula: y = 2x.

If x = 2 then y = 4. Always.

If x = 3 then y = 6. Always.

If x = 3, y won’t sometimes be 9 or –1 or 2.5
depending on the time of day or the state of the stock market.

If y = 2x and x = 3, y will always be 6.

If we made this into a JavaScript function,
it would look like this:

```jsx
function double(number) {
  return 2 * number;
}
```

In the above example,
double is a pure function.
If you pass it 3,
it will return 6. Always.

React is designed around this concept.
<b>React assumes that every component you write is a pure function.</b>
This means that React components you write
must always return the same JSX
given the same inputs:

```jsx
// App.js
function Recipe({ drinkers }) {
  return (
    <ol>
      <li>Boil {drinkers} cups of water.</li>
      <li>
        Add {drinkers} spoons of tea and {0.5 * drinkers} spoons of spice.
      </li>
      <li>Add {0.5 * drinkers} cups of milk to boil and sugar to taste.</li>
    </ol>
  );
}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Spiced Chai Recipe</h1>
      <h2>For two</h2>
      <Recipe drinkers={2} />
      <h2>For a gathering</h2>
      <Recipe drinkers={4} />
    </section>
  );
}
```

When you pass drinkers={2} to Recipe,
it will return JSX containing 2 cups of water.
Always.

If you pass drinkers={4},
it will return JSX containing 4 cups of water.
Always.

Just like a math formula.

You could think of your components as recipes:
if you follow them
and don’t introduce new ingredients
during the cooking process,
you will get the same dish every time.
That “dish” is the JSX
that the component serves to React to render.

## Side Effects: (un)intended consequences

React’s rendering process must always be pure.
Components should only return their JSX,
and not change any objects or variables
that existed before rendering
—that would make them impure!

Here is a component that breaks this rule:

```jsx
// App.js
let guest = 0;

function Cup() {
  // Bad: changing a preexisting variable!
  guest = guest + 1;
  return <h2>Tea cup for guest #{guest}</h2>;
}

export default function TeaSet() {
  return (
    <>
      <Cup />
      <Cup />
      <Cup />
    </>
  );
}
```

This component
is reading and writing a guest variable
declared outside of it.
This means that
<b>calling this component multiple times
will produce different JSX!</b>
And what’s more,
if other components read guest,
they will produce different JSX,
too, depending on when they were rendered!
That’s not predictable.

Going back to our formula y = 2x,
now even if x = 2,
we cannot trust that y = 4.
Our tests could fail,
our users would be baffled,
planes would fall out of the sky
—you can see how this would lead to confusing bugs!

You can fix this component by passing guest as a prop instead:

```jsx
// App.js
function Cup({ guest }) {
  return <h2>Tea cup for guest #{guest}</h2>;
}

export default function TeaSet() {
  return (
    <>
      <Cup guest={1} />
      <Cup guest={2} />
      <Cup guest={3} />
    </>
  );
}
```

Now your component is pure,
as the JSX it returns only depends on the guest prop.

In general,
you should not expect your components to be rendered in any particular order.
It doesn’t matter if you call y = 2x before or after y = 5x:
both formulas will resolve independently of each other.
In the same way,
each component should only “think for itself”,
and
not attempt to coordinate with
or depend upon others during rendering.
Rendering is like a school exam:
each component should calculate JSX on their own!

### DEEP DIVE

Detecting impure calculations with StrictMode

Although you might not have used them all yet,
in React
there are three kinds of inputs
that you can read while rendering:
props, state, and context.
You should always treat these inputs
as read-only.

When you want to change something in response to user input,
you should set state
instead of writing to a variable.
You should never change preexisting variables or objects
while your component is rendering.

React offers a “Strict Mode”
in which it calls each component’s function twice
during development.
By calling the component functions twice,
Strict Mode helps find components that break these rules.

Notice how the original example displayed “Guest #2”, “Guest #4”, and “Guest #6”
instead of “Guest #1”, “Guest #2”, and “Guest #3”.
The original function was impure,
so calling it twice broke it.
But the fixed pure version works
even if the function is called twice every time.
<b>Pure functions only calculate,
so calling them twice
won’t change anything</b>
—just like calling double(2) twice
doesn’t change what’s returned,
and solving y = 2x twice doesn’t change what y is.
Same inputs,
same outputs.
Always.

Strict Mode has no effect in production,
so it won’t slow down the app for your users.
To opt into Strict Mode,
you can wrap your root component into \<React.StrictMode>.
Some frameworks do this by default.

### Local mutation: Your component’s little secret

In the above example,
the problem was that
the component changed a preexisting variable
while rendering.
This is often called a <b>“mutation”</b>
to make it sound a bit scarier.
Pure functions don’t mutate variables outside of the function’s scope or objects
that were created before the call
—that makes them impure!

However,
<b>it’s completely fine to change variables and objects that
you’ve just created
while rendering.</b>
In this example,
you create an [] array,
assign it to a cups variable,
and then push a dozen cups into it:

```jsx
// App.js
function Cup({ guest }) {
  return <h2>Tea cup for guest #{guest}</h2>;
}

export default function TeaGathering() {
  let cups = [];
  for (let i = 1; i <= 12; i++) {
    cups.push(<Cup key={i} guest={i} />);
  }
  return cups;
}
```

If the cups variable or the [] array
were created outside the TeaGathering function,
this would be a huge problem!
You would be changing a preexisting object
by pushing items into that array.

However,
it’s fine
because you’ve created them
during the same render,
inside TeaGathering.
No code outside of TeaGathering
will ever know that this happened.
This is called “local mutation”
—it’s like your component’s little secret.

## Where you can cause side effects

While functional programming relies heavily on purity,
at some point, somewhere, something has to change.
That’s kind of the point of programming!
These changes
—updating the screen, starting an animation, changing the data—
are called side effects.
They’re things that happen “on the side”,
not during rendering.

In React,
<b>side effects usually
belong inside event handlers.</b>
Event handlers are functions that
React runs when you perform some action
—for example, when you click a button.
Even though event handlers are defined inside your component,
they don’t run during rendering!
<b>So event handlers don’t need to be pure.</b>

If you’ve exhausted all other options
and can’t find the right event handler
for your side effect,
you can still attach it to your returned JSX
with a useEffect call in your component.
This tells React to execute it later, after rendering,
when side effects are allowed.
<b>However, this approach should be your last resort.</b>

When possible,
try to express your logic with rendering alone.
You’ll be surprised how far this can take you!

### DEEP DIVE

Why does React care about purity?

Writing pure functions
takes some habit and discipline.
But it also unlocks marvelous opportunities:

- Your components could run in a different environment
  —for example, on the server!
  Since they return the same result for the same inputs,
  one component can serve many user requests.
- You can improve performance
  by skipping rendering components
  whose inputs have not changed.
  This is safe
  because pure functions always return the same results,
  so they are safe to cache.
- If some data changes in the middle of rendering a deep component tree,
  React can restart rendering
  without wasting time to finish the outdated render.
  Purity makes it safe to stop calculating at any time.

Every new React feature we’re building
takes advantage of purity.
From data fetching to animations to performance,
keeping components pure
unlocks the power of the React paradigm.

## Recap

<ul>
    <li>A component must be pure, meaning:</li>
    <ul>
        <li><b>It minds its own business.</b>
        It should not change any objects or variables
        that existed before rendering.
</li>
        <li><b>Same inputs, same output.</b>
        Given the same inputs,
        a component should always return the same JSX.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Rendering can happen at any time,
    so components should not depend on each others’ rendering sequence.</li>
    <li>You should not mutate any of the inputs that
    your components use for rendering.
    That includes props, state, and context.
    To update the screen,
    “set” state
    instead of mutating preexisting objects.</li>
    <li>Strive to express your component’s logic in the JSX you return.
    When you need to “change things”,
    you’ll usually want to do it in an event handler.
    As a last resort, you can useEffect.</li>
    <li>Writing pure functions takes a bit of practice,
    but it unlocks the power of React’s paradigm.</li>

## Try out some challenges

### Challenge 1 of 3:

#### Fix a broken clock

This component tries to set the \<h1>’s CSS class to "night"
during the time from midnight to six hours in the morning,
and "day" at all other times.
However, it doesn’t work.
Can you fix this component?

You can verify whether your solution works
by temporarily changing the computer’s timezone.
When the current time is between midnight and six in the morning,
the clock should have inverted colors!

```jsx
// Clock.js
export default function Clock({ time }) {
  let hours = time.getHours();
  if (hours >= 0 && hours <= 6) {
    document.getElementById("time").className = "night";
  } else {
    document.getElementById("time").className = "day";
  }
  return <h1 id="time">{time.toLocaleTimeString()}</h1>;
}
```

```jsx
export default function Clock({ time }) {
  let hours = time.getHours();
  let className;
  if (hours >= 0 && hours <= 6) {
    className = "night";
  } else {
    className = "day";
  }
  return (
    <h1 id="time" className={className}>
      {time.toLocaleTimeString()}
    </h1>
  );
}
```

### Challenge 2 of 3:

#### Fix a broken profile

Two Profile components are rendered side by side with different data.
Press “Collapse” on the first profile,
and then “Expand” it.
You’ll notice that both profiles now show the same person.
This is a bug.

Find the cause of the bug and fix it.

```jsx
// Profile.js
import Panel from './Panel.js';
import { getImageUrl } from './utils.js';

let currentPerson;

export default function Profile({ person }) {
  currentPerson = person;
  return (
    <Panel>
      <Header />
      <Avatar />
    </Panel>
  )
}

function Header() {
  return <h1>{currentPerson.name}</h1>;
}

function Avatar() {
  return (
    <img
      className="avatar"
      src={getImageUrl(currentPerson)}
      alt={currentPerson.name}
      width={50}
      height={50}
    />
  );
}

// App.js
import Profile from './Profile.js';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <Profile person={{
        imageId: 'lrWQx8l',
        name: 'Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar',
      }} />
      <Profile person={{
        imageId: 'MK3eW3A',
        name: 'Creola Katherine Johnson',
      }} />
    </>
  )
}
```

```jsx
// Profile.js
import Panel from "./Panel.js";
import { getImageUrl } from "./utils.js";

export default function Profile({ person }) {
  return (
    <Panel>
      <Header name={person.name} />
      <Avatar person={person} />
    </Panel>
  );
}

function Header({ name }) {
  return <h1>{name}</h1>;
}

function Avatar({ person }) {
  return (
    <img
      className="avatar"
      src={getImageUrl(person)}
      alt={person.name}
      width={50}
      height={50}
    />
  );
}
```

### Challenge 3 of 3:

#### Fix a broken story tray

The CEO of your company
is asking you
to add “stories”
to your online clock app,
and you can’t say no.
You’ve written a StoryTray component that
accepts a list of stories,
followed by a “Create Story” placeholder.

You implemented the “Create Story” placeholder
by pushing one more fake story
at the end of the stories array
that you receive as a prop.
But for some reason,
“Create Story” appears more than once.
Fix the issue.

```jsx
// StoryTray.js
export default function StoryTray({ stories }) {
  stories.push({
    id: "create",
    label: "Create Story",
  });

  return (
    <ul>
      {stories.map((story) => (
        <li key={story.id}>{story.label}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

```jsx
export default function StoryTray({ stories }) {
  let newArray = [
    ...stories,
    {
      id: "create",
      label: "Create Story",
    },
  ];

  return (
    <ul>
      {newArray.map((story) => (
        <li key={story.id}>{story.label}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```
