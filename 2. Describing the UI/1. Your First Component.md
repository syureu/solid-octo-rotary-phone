# Your First Component

Components are one of the core concepts of React.
They are the foundation upon which you build user interfaces (UI),
which makes them the perfect place to start your React journey!

## Components: UI building blocks

On the Web,
HTML lets us create rich structured documents with its built-in set of tags like \<h1> and \<li>:

```html
<article>
  <h1>My First Component</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Components: UI Building Blocks</li>
    <li>Defining a Component</li>
    <li>Using a Component</li>
  </ol>
</article>
```

This markup represents this article \<article>,
its heading \<h1>,
and an (abbreviated) table of contents as an ordered list \<ol>.
Markup like this,
combined with CSS for style,
and JavaScript for interactivity,
lies behind every sidebar, avatar, modal, dropdown
‚Äîevery piece of UI you see on the Web.

React lets you combine your markup, CSS, and JavaScript into custom ‚Äúcomponents‚Äù,
<b> reusable UI elements for your app. </b>
The table of contents code you saw above
could be turned into a \<TableOfContents /> component
you could render on every page.
Under the hood,
it still uses the same HTML tags like \<article>, \<h1>, etc.

Just like with HTML tags, you can compose, order and nest components to design whole pages.
For example, the documentation page you‚Äôre reading is made out of React components:

```jsx
<PageLayout>
  <NavigationHeader>
    <SearchBar />
    <Link to="/docs">Docs</Link>
  </NavigationHeader>
  <Sidebar />
  <PageContent>
    <TableOfContents />
    <DocumentationText />
  </PageContent>
</PageLayout>
```

As your project grows,
you will notice that many of your designs
can be composed by reusing components you already wrote,
speeding up your development.
Our table of contents above
could be added to any screen with \<TableOfContents />!
You can even jumpstart your project with the thousands of components
shared by the React open source community like Chakra UI and Material UI.

## Defining a component

Traditionally when creating web pages,
web developers marked up their content
and then added interaction by sprinkling on some JavaScript.
This worked great when interaction was a nice-to-have on the web.
Now it is expected for many sites and all apps.
React puts interactivity first while still using the same technology:
<b>a React component is a JavaScript function
that you can sprinkle with markup.</b>
Here‚Äôs what that looks like (you can edit the example below):

```jsx
// App.js
export default function Profile() {
  return <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3Am.jpg" alt="Katherine Johnson" />;
}
```

And here‚Äôs how to build a component:

### Step 1: Export the component

The export default prefix is a standard JavaScript syntax (not specific to React).
It lets you mark the main function in a file
so that you can later import it from other files.
(More on importing in Importing and Exporting Components!)

### Step 2: Define the function

With function Profile() { } you define a JavaScript function with the name Profile.

### Pitfall

React components are regular JavaScript functions,
but <b>their names must start with a capital letter</br> or they won‚Äôt work!

### Step 3: Add markup

The component returns an \<img /> tag with src and alt attributes.
\<img /> is written like HTML, but it is actually JavaScript under the hood!
This syntax is called JSX, and it lets you embed markup inside JavaScript.

Return statements can be written all on one line, as in this component:

```jsx
return <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg" alt="Katherine Johnson" />;
```

But if your markup isn‚Äôt all on the same line as the return keyword, you must wrap it in a pair of parentheses:

```jsx
return (
  <div>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg" alt="Katherine Johnson" />
  </div>
);
```

### Pitfall

Without parentheses, any code on the lines after return will be ignored!

## Using a component

Now that you‚Äôve defined your Profile component,
you can nest it inside other components.
For example, you can export a Gallery component that uses multiple Profile components:

```jsx
// App.js
function Profile() {
  return <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg" alt="Katherine Johnson" />;
}

export default function Gallery() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Amazing scientists</h1>
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
    </section>
  );
}
```

### What the browser sees

Notice the difference in casing:

- \<section> is lowercase, so React knows we refer to an HTML tag.
- \<Profile /> starts with a capital P, so React knows that we want to use our component called Profile.

And Profile contains even more HTML:
\<img />. In the end, this is what the browser sees:

```html
<section>
  <h1>Amazing scientists</h1>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg" alt="Katherine Johnson" />
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg" alt="Katherine Johnson" />
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg" alt="Katherine Johnson" />
</section>
```

### Nesting and organizing components

Components are regular JavaScript functions,
so you can keep multiple components in the same file.
This is convenient when components are relatively small or tightly related to each other.
If this file gets crowded, you can always move Profile to a separate file.
You will learn how to do this shortly on the page about imports.

Because the Profile components are rendered inside Gallery‚Äîeven several times!
‚Äîwe can say that Gallery is a parent component,
rendering each Profile as a ‚Äúchild‚Äù.
This is part of the magic of React:
you can define a component once,
and then use it in as many places and as many times as you like.

### Pitfall

Components can render other components,
but you must never nest their definitions:

```jsx
export default function Gallery() {
  // üî¥ Never define a component inside another component!
  function Profile() {
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}
```

The snippet above is very slow and causes bugs.
Instead, define every component at the top level:

```jsx
export default function Gallery() {
  // ...
}

// ‚úÖ Declare components at the top level
function Profile() {
  // ...
}
```

When a child component needs some data from a parent,
pass it by props instead of nesting definitions.

### DEEP DIVE

Components all the way down

Your React application begins at a ‚Äúroot‚Äù component.
Usually, it is created automatically when you start a new project.
For example, if you use CodeSandbox or Create React App, the root component is defined in src/App.js.
If you use the framework Next.js, the root component is defined in pages/index.js.
In these examples, you‚Äôve been exporting root components.

Most React apps use components all the way down.
This means that you won‚Äôt only use components for reusable pieces like buttons,
but also for larger pieces like sidebars, lists, and ultimately, complete pages!
Components are a handy way to organize UI code and markup,
even if some of them are only used once.

React-based frameworks take this a step further.
Instead of using an empty HTML file and letting React ‚Äútake over‚Äù managing the page with JavaScript,
they also generate the HTML automatically from your React components.
This allows your app to show some content before the JavaScript code loads.

Still, many websites only use React to add interactivity to existing HTML pages.
They have many root components instead of a single one for the entire page.
You can use as much‚Äîor as little‚ÄîReact as you need.

## Recap

You‚Äôve just gotten your first taste of React!
Let‚Äôs recap some key points.

<ul>
  <li>React lets you create components, reusable UI elements for your app.</li>
  <li>In a React app, every piece of UI is a component.</li>
  <li>React components are regular JavaScript functions except:</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Their names always begin with a capital letter.</li>
    <li>They return JSX markup.</li>
  </ol>
</ul>

## Try out some challenges

### Challenge 1 of 4:

#### Export the component

This sandbox doesn‚Äôt work because the root component is not exported:

```jsx
// App.js
export default function Profile() {
  return <img src="https://i.imgur.com/lICfvbD.jpg" alt="Aklilu Lemma" />;
}
```

```
Error
Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: object. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.
```

Try to fix it yourself before looking at the solution!

### Challenge 2 of 4:

#### Fix the return statement

Something isn‚Äôt right about this return statement. Can you fix it?

```jsx
export default function Profile() {
  return <img src="https://i.imgur.com/jA8hHMpm.jpg" alt="Katsuko Saruhashi" />;
}

// return Î¨∏ Îã§ÏùåÏùò Ï§ÑÎßå Ïù∏ÏãùÌïòÎØÄÎ°ú ÏÜåÍ¥ÑÌò∏Î°ú return statementÎ•º Î¨∂Ïñ¥Ï§òÏïºÌï®
// Îã§Îßå Î¨∂Ïñ¥Ï§¨ÎäîÎç∞ Î¶∞Ìä∏Í∞Ä Î≤óÍ≤®Î≤ÑÎ¶º „Ö† Í∑∏ÎûòÏÑú ÏúÑÏ≤òÎüº ÌïúÏ§ÑÎ°ú Î≥¥ÏûÑ
```

### Challenge 3 of 4 :

#### Spot the mistake

Something‚Äôs wrong with how the Profile component is declared and used.
Can you spot the mistake?
(Try to remember how React distinguishes components from the regular HTML tags!)

```jsx
function Profile() {
  return <img src="https://i.imgur.com/QIrZWGIs.jpg" alt="Alan L. Hart" />;
}

export default function Gallery() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Amazing scientists</h1>
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
    </section>
  );
}
```

```
Warning: The tag <profile> is unrecognized in this browser. If you meant to render a React component, start its name with an uppercase letter.
    at profile
    at section
    at Gallery
```

### Challenge 4 of 4:

#### Your own component

Write a component from scratch.
You can give it any valid name and return any markup.
If you‚Äôre out of ideas,
you can write a Congratulations component that shows \<h1>Good job!\</h1>.
Don‚Äôt forget to export it!

```jsx
// Write your component below!

export default function Scratch() {
  return <h1>Good job!</h1>;
}
```

```
Error
Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: object. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.
```
