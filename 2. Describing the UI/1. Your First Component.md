# Your First Component

Components are one of the core concepts of React.
They are the foundation upon which you build user interfaces (UI),
which makes them the perfect place to start your React journey!

## Components: UI building blocks

On the Web,
HTML lets us create rich structured documents with its built-in set of tags like \<h1> and \<li>:

```html
<article>
  <h1>My First Component</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Components: UI Building Blocks</li>
    <li>Defining a Component</li>
    <li>Using a Component</li>
  </ol>
</article>
```

This markup represents this article \<article>,
its heading \<h1>,
and an (abbreviated) table of contents as an ordered list \<ol>.
Markup like this,
combined with CSS for style,
and JavaScript for interactivity,
lies behind every sidebar, avatar, modal, dropdown
—every piece of UI you see on the Web.

React lets you combine your markup, CSS, and JavaScript into custom “components”,
<b> reusable UI elements for your app. </b>
The table of contents code you saw above
could be turned into a \<TableOfContents /> component
you could render on every page.
Under the hood,
it still uses the same HTML tags like \<article>, \<h1>, etc.

Just like with HTML tags, you can compose, order and nest components to design whole pages.
For example, the documentation page you’re reading is made out of React components:

```jsx
<PageLayout>
  <NavigationHeader>
    <SearchBar />
    <Link to="/docs">Docs</Link>
  </NavigationHeader>
  <Sidebar />
  <PageContent>
    <TableOfContents />
    <DocumentationText />
  </PageContent>
</PageLayout>
```

As your project grows,
you will notice that many of your designs
can be composed by reusing components you already wrote,
speeding up your development.
Our table of contents above
could be added to any screen with \<TableOfContents />!
You can even jumpstart your project with the thousands of components
shared by the React open source community like Chakra UI and Material UI.

## Defining a component

Traditionally when creating web pages,
web developers marked up their content
and then added interaction by sprinkling on some JavaScript.
This worked great when interaction was a nice-to-have on the web.
Now it is expected for many sites and all apps.
React puts interactivity first while still using the same technology:
<b>a React component is a JavaScript function
that you can sprinkle with markup.</b>
Here’s what that looks like (you can edit the example below):

```jsx
// App.js
export default function Profile() {
  return <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3Am.jpg" alt="Katherine Johnson" />;
}
```
