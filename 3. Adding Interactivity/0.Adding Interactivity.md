# Adding Interactivity

Some things on the screen
update in response to user input.
For example,
clicking an image gallery
switches the active image.
In React,
data that changes over time
is called state.
You can add state to any component,
and update it as needed.
In this chapter,
you’ll learn
how to write components that
handle interactions,
update their state,
and display different output over time.

### In this chapter

- How to handle user-initiated events
- How to make components “remember” information with state
- How React updates the UI in two phases
- Why state doesn’t update right after you change it
- How to queue multiple state updates
- How to update an object in state
- How to update an array in state

## Responding to events

React lets you add event handlers to your JSX.
Event handlers are your own functions that
will be triggered in response to user interactions
like clicking, hovering, focusing on form inputs, and so on.

Built-in components like \<button>
only support built-in browser events like onClick.
However,
you can also
create your own components,
and
give their event handler props any application-specific names that you like.

```jsx
// App.js
export default function App() {
  return (
    <Toolbar
      onPlayMovie={() => alert("Playing!")}
      onUploadImage={() => alert("Uploading!")}
    />
  );
}

function Toolbar({ onPlayMovie, onUploadImage }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button onClick={onPlayMovie}>Play Movie</Button>
      <Button onClick={onUploadImage}>Upload Image</Button>
    </div>
  );
}

function Button({ onClick, children }) {
  return <button onClick={onClick}>{children}</button>;
}
```
