# Updating arrays in state

Arrays are mutable in JavaScript,
but you should treat them as immutable
when you store them in state.
Just like with objects,
when you want to update an array stored in state,
you need to create a new one
(or make a copy of an existing one),
and then set state to use the new array.

## Updating arrays without mutation

In JavaScript,
arrays are just another kind of object.
Like with objects,
<b>you should treat arrays in React state as read-only.</b>
This means that
you shouldn’t reassign items inside an array
like arr[0] = 'bird',
and you also shouldn’t use methods that
mutate the array,
such as push() and pop().

Instead,
every time you want to update an array,
you’ll want to pass a new array
to your state setting function.
To do that,
you can create a new array
from the original array in your state
by calling its non-mutating methods
like filter() and map().
Then you can set your state to the resulting new array.

|           | avoid (mutates the array)       | prefer (returns a new array)             |
| --------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| adding    | push, unshift                   | concat, [...arr] spread syntax (example) |
| removing  | pop, shift, splice              | filter, slice (example)                  |
| replacing | splice, arr[i] = ... assignment | map (example)                            |
| sorting   | reverse, sort                   | copy the array first (example)           |

Alternatively,
you can use Immer
which lets you use methods from both columns.

### Pitfall

Unfortunately,
slice and splice are named similarly
but are very different:

- slice lets you copy an array or a part of it.
- splice mutates the array (to insert or delete items).

In React,
you will be using slice (no p!) a lot more often
because you don’t want to mutate objects or arrays in state.
Updating Objects explains
what mutation is
and why it’s not recommended for state.

### Adding to an array

push() will mutate an array,
which you don’t want:

```jsx
// App.js
import { useState } from "react";

let nextId = 0;

export default function List() {
  const [name, setName] = useState("");
  const [artists, setArtists] = useState([]);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Inspiring sculptors:</h1>
      <input value={name} onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)} />
      <button
        onClick={() => {
          artists.push({
            id: nextId++,
            name: name,
          });
        }}
      >
        Add
      </button>
      <ul>
        {artists.map((artist) => (
          <li key={artist.id}>{artist.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}
```

Instead,
create a new array
which contains the existing items
and a new item at the end.
There are multiple ways to do this,
but the easiest one
is to use the ... array spread syntax:

```jsx
setArtists(
  // Replace the state
  [
    // with a new array
    ...artists, // that contains all the old items
    { id: nextId++, name: name }, // and one new item at the end
  ]
);
```

Now it works correctly:

```jsx
// App.js
import { useState } from "react";

let nextId = 0;

export default function List() {
  const [name, setName] = useState("");
  const [artists, setArtists] = useState([]);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Inspiring sculptors:</h1>
      <input value={name} onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)} />
      <button
        onClick={() => {
          setArtists([...artists, { id: nextId++, name: name }]);
        }}
      >
        Add
      </button>
      <ul>
        {artists.map((artist) => (
          <li key={artist.id}>{artist.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}
```
