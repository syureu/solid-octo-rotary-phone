# Render and commit

Before your components are displayed on screen,
they must be rendered by React.
Understanding the steps in this process
will help you think about
how your code executes and explain its behavior.

### You will learn

- What rendering means in React
- When and why React renders a component
- The steps involved in displaying a component on screen
- Why rendering does not always produce a DOM update

Imagine that
your components are cooks in the kitchen,
assembling tasty dishes from ingredients.
In this scenario,
React is the waiter
who puts in requests from customers
and brings them their orders.
This process of requesting and serving UI has three steps:

1. <b>Triggering</b> a render
   (delivering the guest’s order to the kitchen)
2. <b>Rendering</b> the component
   (preparing the order in the kitchen)
3. <b>Committing</b> to the DOM
   (placing the order on the table)

## Step 1: Trigger a render

There are two reasons for a component to render:

1. It’s the component’s <b>initial render.</b>
2. The component’s (or one of its ancestors’) <b>state has been updated.</b>

### Initial render

When your app starts,
you need to trigger the initial render.
Frameworks and sandboxes
sometimes hide this code,
but it’s done by calling createRoot with the target DOM node,
and then calling its render method with your component:

```jsx
// index.js
import Image from "./Image.js";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(<Image />);

// Image.js
export default function Image() {
  return (
    <img
      src="https://i.imgur.com/ZF6s192.jpg"
      alt="'Floralis Genérica' by Eduardo Catalano: a gigantic metallic flower sculpture with reflective petals"
    />
  );
}
```

Try commenting out the root.render() call
and see the component disappear!
