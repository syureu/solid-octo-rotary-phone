# Render and commit

Before your components are displayed on screen,
they must be rendered by React.
Understanding the steps in this process
will help you think about
how your code executes and explain its behavior.

### You will learn

- What rendering means in React
- When and why React renders a component
- The steps involved in displaying a component on screen
- Why rendering does not always produce a DOM update

Imagine that
your components are cooks in the kitchen,
assembling tasty dishes from ingredients.
In this scenario,
React is the waiter
who puts in requests from customers
and brings them their orders.
This process of requesting and serving UI has three steps:

1. <b>Triggering</b> a render
   (delivering the guest’s order to the kitchen)
2. <b>Rendering</b> the component
   (preparing the order in the kitchen)
3. <b>Committing</b> to the DOM
   (placing the order on the table)

## Step 1: Trigger a render

There are two reasons for a component to render:

1. It’s the component’s <b>initial render.</b>
2. The component’s (or one of its ancestors’) <b>state has been updated.</b>

### Initial render

When your app starts,
you need to trigger the initial render.
Frameworks and sandboxes
sometimes hide this code,
but it’s done by calling createRoot with the target DOM node,
and then calling its render method with your component:

```jsx
// index.js
import Image from "./Image.js";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(<Image />);

// Image.js
export default function Image() {
  return (
    <img
      src="https://i.imgur.com/ZF6s192.jpg"
      alt="'Floralis Genérica' by Eduardo Catalano: a gigantic metallic flower sculpture with reflective petals"
    />
  );
}
```

Try commenting out the root.render() call
and see the component disappear!

### Re-renders when state updates

Once the component has been initially rendered,
you can trigger further renders
by updating its state with the set function.
Updating your component’s state automatically queues a render.
(You can imagine these
as a restaurant guest ordering
tea, dessert, and all sorts of things after putting in their first order,
depending on the state of their thirst or hunger.)

...render!

## Step 2: React renders your components

After you trigger a render,
React calls
your components to figure out
what to display on screen.
<b>“Rendering” is
React calling your components.</b>

- <b>On initial render,</b>
  React will call the root component.
  <b>For subsequent renders,</b>
  React will call the function component
  whose state update triggered the render.

This process is recursive:
if the updated component
returns some other component,
React will render that component next,
and if that component also returns something,
it will render that component next, and so on.
The process will continue
until there are no more nested components
and React knows exactly
what should be displayed on screen.

In the following example,
React will call Gallery() and Image() several times:

```jsx
// Gallery.js
export default function Gallery() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Inspiring Sculptures</h1>
      <Image />
      <Image />
      <Image />
    </section>
  );
}

function Image() {
  return (
    <img
      src="https://i.imgur.com/ZF6s192.jpg"
      alt="'Floralis Genérica' by Eduardo Catalano: a gigantic metallic flower sculpture with reflective petals"
    />
  );
}

// index.js
import Gallery from "./Gallery.js";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(<Gallery />);
```

- During the initial render,
  React will create the DOM nodes for
  \<section>, \<h1>, and three \<img> tags.
- During a re-render,
  React will calculate which of their properties, if any,
  have changed since the previous render.
  It won’t do anything with
  that information until the next step, the commit phase.

### Pitfall

Rendering must always be a pure calculation:

- Same inputs,
  same output.
  Given the same inputs,
  a component should always return the same JSX.
  (When someone orders a salad with tomatoes,
  they should not receive a salad with onions!)
- It minds its own business.
  It should not change any objects or variables
  that existed before rendering.
  (One order
  should not change
  anyone else’s order.)

Otherwise,
you can encounter confusing bugs
and unpredictable behavior
as your codebase grows in complexity.
When developing in “Strict Mode”,
React calls each component’s function twice,
which can help surface mistakes
caused by impure functions.

### DEEP DIVE

Optimizing performance

The default behavior of rendering
all components nested within the updated component
is not optimal for performance
if the updated component is very high in the tree.
If you run into a performance issue,
there are several opt-in ways to solve it
described in the Performance section.
Don’t optimize prematurely!

## Step 3: React commits changes to the DOM

After rendering (calling) your components,
React will modify the DOM.

- <b>For the initial render,</b>
  React will use the appendChild() DOM API
  to put all the DOM nodes it has created on screen.
- <b>For re-renders,</b>
  React will apply the minimal necessary operations
  (calculated while rendering!)
  to make the DOM match the latest rendering output.

<b>React only changes the DOM nodes
if there’s a difference between renders.</b>
For example,
here is a component
that re-renders
with different props passed
from its parent
every second.
Notice
how you can add some text into the \<input>,
updating its value,
but the text doesn’t disappear when the component re-renders:

```jsx
// Clock.js
export default function Clock({ time }) {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>{time}</h1>
      <input />
    </>
  );
}
```

This works
because during this last step,
React only updates the content of
\<h1> with the new time.
It sees that
the \<input> appears in the JSX in the same place as last time,
so React doesn’t touch the \<input>—or its value!

## Epilogue: Browser paint

After rendering is done
and React updated the DOM,
the browser will repaint the screen.
Although this process is known as “browser rendering”,
we’ll refer to it as “painting”
to avoid confusion throughout the docs.
