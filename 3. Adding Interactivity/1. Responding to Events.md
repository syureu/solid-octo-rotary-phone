# Responding to Events

React lets you add event handlers to your JSX.
Event handlers are your own functions that
will be triggered in response to interactions
like clicking, hovering, focusing form inputs, and so on.

### You will learn

- Different ways to write an event handler
- How to pass event handling logic from a parent component
- How events propagate and how to stop them

## Adding event handlers

To add an event handler,
you will first define a function
and then pass it as a prop
to the appropriate JSX tag.
For example,
here is a button that doesnâ€™t do anything yet:

```jsx
// App.js
export default function Button() {
  return <button>I don't do anything</button>;
}
```
