# Responding to Events

React lets you add event handlers to your JSX.
Event handlers are your own functions that
will be triggered in response to interactions
like clicking, hovering, focusing form inputs, and so on.

## Adding event handlers

To add an event handler,
you will first define a function
and then pass it as a prop
to the appropriate JSX tag.
For example,
here is a button that doesn’t do anything yet:

```jsx
// App.js
export default function Button() {
  return <button>I don't do anything</button>;
}
```

You can make it show a message
when a user clicks by following these three steps:

1. Declare a function called handleClick inside your Button component.
2. Implement the logic inside that function (use alert to show the message).
3. Add onClick={handleClick} to the \<button> JSX.

```jsx
// App.js
export default function Button() {
  function handleClick() {
    alert("You clicked me!");
  }

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>;
}
```

You defined the handleClick function
and then passed it as a prop to \<button>.
handleClick is an event handler.
Event handler functions:

- Are usually defined inside your components.
- Have names that start with handle,
  followed by the name of the event.

By convention,
it is common to name event handlers as handle
followed by the event name.
You’ll often see onClick={handleClick},
onMouseEnter={handleMouseEnter}, and so on.

Alternatively, you can define an event handler inline in the JSX:

```jsx
<button onClick={function handleClick() {
  alert('You clicked me!');
}}>
```

Or, more concisely, using an arrow function:

```jsx
<button onClick={() => {
  alert('You clicked me!');
}}>
```

All of these styles are equivalent.
Inline event handlers are convenient for short functions.
