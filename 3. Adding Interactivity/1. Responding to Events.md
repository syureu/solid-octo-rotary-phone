# Responding to Events

React lets you add event handlers to your JSX.
Event handlers are your own functions that
will be triggered in response to interactions
like clicking, hovering, focusing form inputs, and so on.

- How events propagate and how to stop them

## Adding event handlers

To add an event handler,
you will first define a function
and then pass it as a prop
to the appropriate JSX tag.
For example,
here is a button that doesnâ€™t do anything yet:

```jsx
// App.js
export default function Button() {
  return <button>I don't do anything</button>;
}
```

You can make it show a message
when a user clicks by following these three steps:

1. Declare a function called handleClick inside your Button component.
2. Implement the logic inside that function (use alert to show the message).
3. Add onClick={handleClick} to the \<button> JSX.

```jsx
// App.js
export default function Button() {
  function handleClick() {
    alert("You clicked me!");
  }

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>;
}
```
