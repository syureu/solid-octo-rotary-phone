# Updating Objects in State

State can hold any kind of JavaScript value,
including objects.
But you shouldnâ€™t change objects that
you hold in the React state directly.
Instead,
when you want to update an object,
you need to create a new one
(or make a copy of an existing one),
and then set the state to use that copy.
