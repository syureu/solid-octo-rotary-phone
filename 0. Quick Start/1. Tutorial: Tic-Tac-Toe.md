# Tutorial: Tic-Tac-Toe

You will build a small tic-tac-toe game during this tutorial.
This tutorial does not assume any existing React knowledge.
The techniques you’ll learn in the tutorial are fundamental to building any React app,
and fully understanding it will give you a deep understanding of React.

### Note

This tutorial is designed for people who prefer to learn by doing and want to quickly try making something tangible.
If you prefer learning each concept step by step, start with Describing the UI.

The tutorial is divided into several sections:

- Setup for the tutorial will give you a starting point to follow the tutorial.
- Overview will teach you the fundamentals of React: components, props, and state.
- Completing the game will teach you the most common techniques in React development.
- Adding time travel will give you a deeper insight into the unique strengths of React.

## What are you building?

In this tutorial, you’ll build an interactive tic-tac-toe game with React.

You can see what it will look like when you’re finished here:

```javascript
import { useState } from 'react';

function Square({ value, onSquareClick }) {
  return (
    <button className="square" onClick={onSquareClick}>
      {value}
    </button>
  );
}

function Board({ xIsNext, squares, onPlay }) {
  function handleClick(i) {
    if (calculateWinner(squares) || squares[i]) {
      return;
    }
    const nextSquares = squares.slice();
    if (xIsNext) {
      nextSquares[i] = 'X';
    } else {
      nextSquares[i] = 'O';
    }
    onPlay(nextSquares);
  }

  const winner = calculateWinner(squares);
  let status;
  if (winner) {
    status = 'Winner: ' + winner;
  } else {
    status = 'Next player: ' + (xIsNext ? 'X' : 'O');
  }

  return (
    <>
      <div className="status">{status}</div>
      <div className="board-row">
        <Square value={squares[0]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(0)} />
        <Square value={squares[1]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(1)} />
        <Square value={squares[2]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(2)} />
      </div>
      <div className="board-row">
        <Square value={squares[3]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(3)} />
        <Square value={squares[4]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(4)} />
        <Square value={squares[5]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(5)} />
      </div>
      <div className="board-row">
        <Square value={squares[6]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(6)} />
        <Square value={squares[7]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(7)} />
        <Square value={squares[8]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(8)} />
      </div>
    </>
  );
}

export default function Game() {
  const [history, setHistory] = useState([Array(9).fill(null)]);
  const [currentMove, setCurrentMove] = useState(0);
  const xIsNext = currentMove % 2 === 0;
  const currentSquares = history[currentMove];

  function handlePlay(nextSquares) {
    const nextHistory = [...history.slice(0, currentMove + 1), nextSquares];
    setHistory(nextHistory);
    setCurrentMove(nextHistory.length - 1);
  }

  function jumpTo(nextMove) {
    setCurrentMove(nextMove);
  }

  const moves = history.map((squares, move) => {
    let description;
    if (move > 0) {
      description = 'Go to move #' + move;
    } else {
      description = 'Go to game start';
    }
    return (
      <li key={move}>
        <button onClick={() => jumpTo(move)}>{description}</button>
      </li>
    );
  });

  return (
    <div className="game">
      <div className="game-board">
        <Board xIsNext={xIsNext} squares={currentSquares} onPlay={handlePlay} />
      </div>
      <div className="game-info">
        <ol>{moves}</ol>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

function calculateWinner(squares) {
  const lines = [
    [0, 1, 2],
    [3, 4, 5],
    [6, 7, 8],
    [0, 3, 6],
    [1, 4, 7],
    [2, 5, 8],
    [0, 4, 8],
    [2, 4, 6],
  ];
  for (let i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) {
    const [a, b, c] = lines[i];
    if (squares[a] && squares[a] === squares[b] && squares[a] === squares[c]) {
      return squares[a];
    }
  }
  return null;
}
```

If the code doesn’t make sense to you yet, or if you are unfamiliar with the code’s syntax, don’t worry!
The goal of this tutorial is to help you understand React and its syntax.
We recommend that you check out the tic-tac-toe game above before continuing with the tutorial.
One of the features that you’ll notice is that there is a numbered list to the right of the game’s board.
This list gives you a history of all of the moves that have occurred in the game,
and it is updated as the game progresses.

Once you’ve played around with the finished tic-tac-toe game, keep scrolling.
You’ll start with a simpler template in this tutorial.
Our next step is to set you up so that you can start building the game.

## Setup for the tutorial

In the live code editor below,
click Fork in the top-right corner to open the editor in a new tab using the website CodeSandbox.
CodeSandbox lets you write code in your browser and preview how your users will see the app you’ve created.
The new tab should display an empty square and the starter code for this tutorial.

### Note

You can also follow this tutorial using your local development environment.
To do this, you need to:

1. Install Node.js
2. In the CodeSandbox tab you opened earlier, press the top-left corner button to open the menu, and then choose File > Export to ZIP in that menu to download an archive of the files locally
3. Unzip the archive, then open a terminal and cd to the directory you unzipped
4. Install the dependencies with npm install
5. Run npm start to start a local server and follow the prompts to view the code running in a browser

If you get stuck, don’t let this stop you! Follow along online instead and try a local setup again later.
