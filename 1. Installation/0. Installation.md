# Installation
React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption.
You can use as little or as much React as you need.
Whether you want to get a taste of React, add some interactivity to an HTML page, or start a complex React-powered app, this section will help you get started.

> gradual adoption라고 하니 리액트를 쓴다고 기존의 html, css, js가 확 엎어지는 그런 구조가 아니고 기성 웹 프론트에 녹아들 수 있게 디자인 되었다는 뜻
